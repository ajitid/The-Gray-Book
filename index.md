## Where to start?

Depending on where you come from, you may want to start with one of these introductions:
* [Introduction for Creative Coders](reference/getting-started/cc/introduction-for-creative-coders.md)
* [Introduction for .NET Developers](reference/getting-started/dotnet/introduction-for-dotnet-programmers.md)
* [Introduction for vvvv beta users](reference/getting-started/beta/introduction-for-vvvv-beta-users.md)

Also, vvvv has a built-in HelpBrowser, press <span class="keyseq"><kbd>F1</kbd></span> to open it. On the ``Learn`` tab 
you find help for each library: Browse the ``Examples`` and ``Tutorials`` first. When you have more specific questions, consult the ``HowTo's`` and ``Explanations``.
