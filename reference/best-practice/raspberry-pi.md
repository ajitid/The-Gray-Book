# Deploying to a Raspberry Pi

As of [version 5.0](../../changelog/5.x.md) you can now [export](../hde/exporting.md) console apps to Linux, which makes the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) an excellent target. 

In the [Application Exporter](../hde/exporting.md) then specify:
- Output type: Console Application
- Target: Linux

## Deployment modes
As explained in [Deploy .NET apps on ARM single-board computers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/iot/deployment#deploying-a-framework-dependent-app) there are two modes of deploymnet:

### Framework dependent
This is the default used by the Exporter. It requires you to [install .NET on the Raspberry Pi](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/iot/deployment#deploying-a-framework-dependent-app) (Follow steps 1. and 2.) in order to be able to run the export on it. 

After a successful export, copy the generated files over to the PI and there on a commandline run the program by typing:

``dotnet myprogram.dll``

### Self-contained
Using this option will not require you to install .NET!

Run the export normally once, then press the "Show Details" button. At the very top you'll see a line looking like this:

``dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained false /clp:ErrorsOnly /nologo PathToYourProject.csproj"``

Copy this, open a Command prompt and run the command modified like this:

``dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-arm --self-contained true /clp:ErrorsOnly /nologo PathToYourProject.csproj"``

Use ``-r linux-arm`` for 32bit Raspberry Pi OS or ``-r linux-arm64`` for the 64bit Version.

After a successful export, copy the generated files over to the PI and there on a commandline set execute permissions on the executable:

``chmod +x myprogram``

and then run it:

``./myprogram``

## Automatic deployment of files
Copying the files over to the PI after every build can be automated. In the Exporter UI press ``Advanced build configuration`` and add the following lines inside the ``<Project>`` tag: 

```xml
<PropertyGroup>    
  <SourceFolder>PATH-TO-YOUR-PROJECTS-EXPORT-FOLDER</SourceFolder>
  <DestFolder>PATH-TO-YOUR-DESTINATION-FOLDER-ON-THE-PI</DestFolder>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup>
  <FilesToCopy Include="$(SourceFolder)\**" />
</ItemGroup>

<Target Name="Deploy" AfterTargets="Publish">
  <!-- copy all files from the source folder to the dest folder that are newer or don't exist in the dest folder -->
  <Message Importance="High" Text="Copying files to Raspberry PI..." />
  <Copy SourceFiles="@(FilesToCopy)" DestinationFiles="@(FilesToCopy->'$(DestFolder)\%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')" SkipUnchangedFiles="True">
    <Output TaskParameter="CopiedFiles" ItemName="Copied" />
  </Copy>
    
  <ItemGroup>
    <OutdatedFiles Include="$(DestFolder)\**" Exclude="@(Copied)" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <Message Importance="High" Text="Deleting files..." />
  <Delete Files="@(OutdatedFiles)" />
</Target>
```

Specify ``SourceFolder`` and ``DestFolder``. Then this will copy modified files over to the PI after every build.

## Autostart
To have your application autostart when starting the Pi, you need to install it as a service (other options like rc.local or a .desktop file don't seem to work).

For installing a service, refer to chapter "4.4 Using A Systemd Service" of [boot.pdf](https://github.com/thagrol/Guides/blob/main/boot.pdf).

### Pitfalls
- If your program is accessing files, make sure to set the ``WorkingDirectory`` to where your application resides on disk
- ``ExecStart`` needs to have absolut paths to both "dotnet" and your application. eg.: ``/home/pi/.dotnet/dotnet /home/pi/MyApp/myapp.dll`` 

### Map Pi as network drive
To map your Pi users home directory to the Z drive on your windows machine, in a command prompt run:  

``net use Z: \\[hostname]\[username]``

## Useful NuGets
- [System.Device.Gpio](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Device.Gpio): for GPIO, I2C, SPI, PWM, Serial port
- [Iot.Device.Bindings](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Iot.Device.Bindings): for higher-level specific device support
- [VL.IO.RCP](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.IO.RCP) for remote controlling parameters of the application from a web browser
- Any of the libraries in the [IO](../libraries/io.md) category
- [SFML.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SFML.Net): for audio playback and recording (NOTE: version 2.5.0 of the NuGet has audio recording broken. Compile yourself [from sources](https://github.com/SFML/SFML.Net) to get this working)
