# 3d Graphics

vvvv's 3d rendering engine VL.Stride is based on the [Stride 3d Engine](http://stride3d.net) and shipping with the installation. It allows for 2 distinct workflows:

* A **high-level**, easy to use SceneGraph approach, where you build 3d scenes by simply adding models, and lights to a scene. Models can be given materials to define their look
* A **low-level** approach, where you work with the graphics API directly

Both workflows can be easily combined, see [Rendering](3d/rendering.md) for more details.

 You you can write [shaders](3d/shaders.md) (vertex, pixel, geometry, compute) using the [Stride Shading Language](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/effects-and-shaders/shading-language/index.html) (an extension to HLSL) to customize your rendering in both workflows.

A range of Post FX, like ambient occlusion, depth of field, bloom, etc. are available too. VL.Stride also allows you to output content to VR Devices.

In general the [Stride Documentation](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/) is useful for understanding key concepts of the engine.
