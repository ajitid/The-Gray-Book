# On Demand

If you're missing support for a specific device or library, it can most certainly be added on demand. 

vvvv's libraries are all [open-source](https://github.com/vvvv) and for programmers it is trivial to [extend](../extending/overview.md) them with custom sets of nodes. 

We do offer priority support for your development requirements, please **[get in touch](mailto:devvvvs@vvvv.org)** to see if/how we can work things out together.
